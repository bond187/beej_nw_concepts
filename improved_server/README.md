An improved version of the webserver from the first project. It responds to requests for a specific file that is specified in the url and sends the contents of that file. It currently supports .txt, .html, .jpeg/.jpg file types. <br> **TODO**: Add functionality to allow client to request to view the file structure from a certain supplied point.
